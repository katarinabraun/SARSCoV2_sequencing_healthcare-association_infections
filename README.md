## Abstract 

**Background**
Healthcare personnel (HCP) are at increased risk of infection with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2019 virus (SARS-CoV-2). Between 12 March 2020 and 10 January 2021, >1,170 HCP tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at a major academic medical institution in the Upper Midwest of the United States. We aimed to understand the sources of infections in HCP and to evaluate the efficacy of infection control procedures used to protect HCP from healthcare-associated transmission. 

**Methods**
In this retrospective study, we used viral genomics to investigate the likely source of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 96 HCP where epidemiological data alone could not be used to rule out healthcare-associated transmission. We obtained limited epidemiological data through informal interviews and Epic Systemsâ€™ comprehensive caregiver trace in the electronic medical record. We combined viral sequence data and available epidemiological information to infer the most likely source of HCP infection. 

**Findings**
We investigated 32 healthcare-associated SARS-CoV-2 infection clusters involving 140 patients, 96 HCP, and 1 household contact (total n = 237). Of these, 182 sequences met quality standards and were used for downstream analysis. We find the majority of HCP infections cannot be linked to a patient or co-worker and therefore likely occurred in the outside community (58/96; 60.4%). We find a smaller percentage can be traced to a coworker (10/96; 10.4%) or are part of a patient-employee cluster (12/96; 12.5%). Strikingly, the smallest proportion of HCP infections can be clearly traced to a patient source (4/96; 4.2%). 

**Interpretation**
Infection control procedures, consistently followed, offer significant protection to HCP caring for COVID-19 patients in a representative American academic medical institution. Rapid SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing in healthcare settings can be used retrospectively to reconstruct the likely source of HCP infection when epidemiological data are not available or are inconclusive. Understanding the source of SARS-CoV-2 infection can then be used prospectively to adjust and improve infection control practices and guidelines. 

**Funding**
This project was funded in part through a COVID-19 Response grant from the Wisconsin Partnership Program at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health to T.C.F. and D.H.O.
